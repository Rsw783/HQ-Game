# HQ-Game

This was a start of a silly game I had started creating back in highschool. 
As it stands the farthest I got was making a menu system and setting up the game window due to a lack of assests to test code with and an aversion to using ones from the internet.
That being said some copywritten files may still exist within the project, however no claim it being made on anything except the code itself.
